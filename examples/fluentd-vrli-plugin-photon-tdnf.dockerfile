# Builds a photon-based image that contains fluentd, fluent-plugin-vmware-loginsight some of the tools recommended by fluent
# (libjemalloc, oj, assync-http). This image is based on the minimalistic VMware Photon OS so the result is smaller in size.
# Furthermore, all of the needed components are installed from the trusted Photon repository by using the tdnf package manager.
#
# Fluentd is configured with the default configuration that gets produced by the `fluentd --setup` command. For an example of
# a configuration that uses the fluent-plugin-vmware-loginsight plugin check fluent.conf under the examples dir:
# https://github.com/vmware/fluent-plugin-vmware-loginsight/blob/master/examples/fluent.conf
